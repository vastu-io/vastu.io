## Vastu Shastra

Vastu Shastra is a traditional concept in Hindu system of architecture, which translates to 'science of architecture'. It is an ancient Indian science developed thousands of years ago by Indian sages. According to Viswakarma - an architect who is considered the creator of Vastu described Vastu as a science complete in itself. 

Vastu Shastra is the ancient Indian science of architecture, which governs town planning and designing of man-made structures. A part of the Vedas, the word Vastu in Sanskrit means "dwelling," and in the modern context, it covers all buildings.

Vastu pertains to the physical, psychological, and spiritual order of the built environment, in consonance with the cosmic energies. It is a study of planetary influences on buildings and the people who live in them, and it aims at providing guidelines for proper construction.
