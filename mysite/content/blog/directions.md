## Most important aspect of Vastu `Directions` 

Directions are the most important aspect of Vastu. Each direction presents opportunity for either spiritual, economic, social or in some other form.

There are primary 4 directions: North, South, East and West -- called cardinal directions, while there are sub-directions such as: North East, South East, North West, South West. Each sub-directions get their fair share such as -- North-NorthEast(NNE), North-NorthWest(NNW), East-NorthEast(ENE), East-SouthEast(ESE), South-SouthEast(SSE), South-SouthWest (SSW), West-NorthWest(WNW), North-NorthWest(NNW)

Thus forming total 16 directions. If I had to represent them in JSON format:
```
{
    "directions": [
        {
            "name": "North"
        },
        {
            "name": "NNE"
        },
        {
            "name": "NE"
        },
        {
            "name": "ENE"
        },
        {
            "name": "East"
        },

        {
            "name": "ESE"
        },

        {
            "name": "SE"
        },

        {
            "name": "SSE"
        },

        {
            "name": "South"
        },

        {
            "name": "SSW"
        },

        {
            "name": "SW"
        },

        {
            "name": "WSW"
        },

        {
            "name": "West"
        },

        {
            "name": "WNW"
        },

        {
            "name": "NW"
        },

        {
            "name": "NNW"
        }

    ]
}

```
