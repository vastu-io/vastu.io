## Principles of Vastu 

The principles of Vastu had been explained in ancient Hindu scriptures, called Puranas, including Skanda Purana, Agni Purana, Garuda Purana, Vishnu Purana, Bruhatsamhita, Kasyapa Shilpa, Agama Sastra and Viswakarma Vastushastra.

The fundamental premise of Vastu rests on the assumption that the earth is a living organism, out of which other living creatures and organic forms emerge, and so every particle on earth and space possesses live energy.

According to Vastushastra, five elements--Earth, Fire, Water, Air (atmosphere) and Sky (space)--govern the principles of creation. These forces act for or against each other to create harmony and disharmony. It also says that everything on earth is influenced in one way or another by the nine planets and that each of these planets guards a direction. So our dwellings are under the influence of the five elements and the nine planets.
